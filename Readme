Requirements:

- docker-compose version 1.29.2
- Docker version 20.10.10
(I have worked with these versions, other versions will probably work too)

How to run:
- Add .env file the same place .envsample file exists
- Run docker-compose build
- Run docker-compose up

Description:
I have added create APIs for user, city, hall and event without proper logic, for the sake of data creation simplicity.
Ticket module has 3 APIs:
- POST /ticket to make reservation
- GET /ticket/event/:id to get information about event's availability 
    I decided not to create tickets each time events are added. 
    When somebody reserves/buys a ticket, data will be added/updated.
    This API will send list of tickets which are not available (either sold or reservation is not expired), which is enough to deduce available tickets.
- GET /user/:id to get information about user's reserved ticket
    This API will send list of user's reserved tickets
- POST /payment
    This API will try to finish payment with mentioned ID.
    As I didn't have third party payment APIs, I have added payment simulator, which randomly throws error.
    This way we may check API behaviour if payment fails.
