Description:

The project uses Typescript, Express.js, PostgreSQL and Typeorm.

I have added create APIs for user, city, hall and event without proper logic, for the sake of data creation simplicity.
They do not have valid logic, but only simple APIs to add data to database.

The core APIs are described below.
Ticket module has 3 APIs:
- POST /ticket to make reservation
- GET /ticket/event/:id to get information about event's availability 
    I decided not to create tickets each time events are added. 
    When somebody reserves/buys a ticket, data will be added/updated.
    This API will send list of tickets which are not available (either sold or reservation is not expired), which is enough to deduce available tickets.
- GET /user/:id to get information about user's reserved ticket
    This API will send list of user's reserved tickets

Payment module has 1 API
- POST /payment
    This API will try to finish payment with mentioned ID.
    As I didn't have third party payment APIs, I have added payment simulator, which randomly throws error.
    This way we may check API behaviour if payment fails.
